# library target(s)
# ============================================================================

# Add library target for each library using basis_add_library().
#
# This command can not only be used to build libraries from C/C++, but also source
# code written in other programming languages such as Java, Python, Perl,
# MATLAB, and Bash. Note that here we consider modules written in a scripting
# language which are no executables but to be included by other scripts written
# in the particular language as libraries.
#
# Note: Public modules written in a scripting language such as Python, Perl,
#       MATLAB, or Bash which are intended for use by other packages should
#       be placed in the lib/[<lang>/]grl/ directory,
#       where <lang> is the language name in lowercase and is optional.
#       BASIS will automatically add a library build target for these modules.
